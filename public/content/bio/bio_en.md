## Research Focus

My research is structural analysis of ceramics, from sintering behavior to anlysis of atomic structure. The main purpose of my research is obtain a relationship between the heating process and structural changes. Firstly, observe the pure monoclinic phase zirconia, which is stable at the low temperature. It's phase is change to tetragonal when it heated more than 1170 degrees. And the volume of monoclinic phase is larger than tetragonal phase, it cause the microcrak on the sintered body. Threrefore, there is limitation for sintering in case of monoclinic zirconia, so the aim is finding the optimal sintering condition from the structural information. Secondly, the yttrium diffusion behavior in the YSZ single crystal.
